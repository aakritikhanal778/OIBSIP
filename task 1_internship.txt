Task 1: Basic scanning using nmap
* Objective: Perform a network scan to identify open ports and services using Nmap.

* Tools: Nmap
Working
1.Requirements: virtual machine with kali linux installed, as it comes with preinstalled nmap and other tools so check whether it is there or not, if not install nmap using this command line
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nmap -y
2. To identity open ports  and services , scanning using nmap for those websites and system which has given permission:
  2.1 1. Basic Host Discovery (Ping Scan)
   
   * -sn means Ping Scan — it checks if the host is up without scanning ports.
   * Useful for confirming if a target is online.
Output : Shows whether the host is up, its IP address, and round-trip time.
2.2  Basic Port Scan (Find Open Ports)
  

   * Scans the most common 1000 TCP ports on the target.
Output: Lists open ports, their state, and the service running.
2.3  Scan Specific Ports
  

  -p lets you scan only specific ports (80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).
Output:Shows only the status of the specified ports.
2.4 Aggressive Scan (OS + Services)
  
-A enables:
   Version detection
   Script scanning
   Traceroute








 2.5 Service Version Detection
  

It detects the version and the service used , the ports and details about that , like open ,close.
-sV detects service versions running on open ports.


2.6 Direct ip scanning using nmap
  



It will direct scan the ip address given and tells about the open ports
